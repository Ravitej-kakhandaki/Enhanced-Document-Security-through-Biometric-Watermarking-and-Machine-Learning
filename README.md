# Enhanced-Document-Security-through-Biometric-Watermarking-and-Machine-Learning
A hybrid biometric authentication system that embeds encrypted fingerprint data into iris images using zero-bit watermarking. By applying DWT, LSB, and Daughmanâ€™s normalization, it generates a secure master ID for verification, ensuring privacy, data protection, and tamper-resistant identity verification.
