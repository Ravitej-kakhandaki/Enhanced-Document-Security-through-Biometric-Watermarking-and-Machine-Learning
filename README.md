# Enhanced-Document-Security-through-Biometric-Watermarking-and-Machine-Learning
A hybrid biometric authentication system that embeds encrypted fingerprint data into iris images using zero-bit watermarking. By applying DWT, LSB, and Daughman’s normalization, it generates a secure master ID for verification, ensuring privacy, data protection, and tamper-resistant identity verification.


🔐 Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing the security of biometric data by embedding encrypted fingerprint information into iris images using a zero-bit watermarking technique. The system combines iris recognition and fingerprint validation into a hybrid biometric authentication method, ensuring privacy, accuracy, and resistance to spoofing.

✨ Key Features

Hybrid Biometrics – Combines fingerprint and iris traits for stronger authentication.

Secure Embedding – Uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding, and Daughman’s normalization for distortion-free data hiding.

Zero-Bit Watermarking – Embeds encrypted fingerprint data inside iris images without altering visible quality.

Master Share Generation – Produces a unique encrypted ID that can authenticate users without exposing original biometric traits.

Privacy Protection – Original fingerprint and iris data are never directly shared, preventing data breaches and misuse.

🎯 Aim

The project aims to create a tamper-resistant and privacy-preserving identity verification system. By securing biometric traits through encryption and watermarking, it ensures that sensitive personal data remains protected while enabling reliable identity verification.
